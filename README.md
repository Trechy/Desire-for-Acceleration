# Desire for Acceleration
An XNA 4.0 C# game made where a player is a cop car speeding down the highway while avoiding civilians cars.  

This is a Windows application made in Visual Studio for educational purposes at Conestoga College and is not meant to published or sold anywhere else.

Note that all the required references and files are not present in this repository. Only the code I made and images I used are present in this repository.  The setup is no available due to Microsoft pulling support fo XNA. I have done some tests and I cannot get XNA to install on Windows 10.

If you're using an older version of Windows like 7 or 8.1 the folder with all the setup files is provided at the following link if you would like to try and install it but I have not been able to test it:

If you would like to install this game on a Windows PC follow the dropbox link, download the entire folder and run the "setup.exe" that is in the "publish" folder.
